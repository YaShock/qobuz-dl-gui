## About

This project provides GUI (using PyQt5) for downloading music via Qobuz API.
It is based on the [qobuz-dl](https://github.com/vitiko98/qobuz-dl) created by vitiko98. I am not a UI expert, therefore I used [Tidal-Media-Downloader](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader) as inspiration.

## Installation

First, install the necessary packages for GUI via pip.

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Then run the main GUI modul from root.

`python qobuz-dl-gui/gui.py`

On first run a qobuz-dl based configuration is created, which can be modified either by hand or (in limited way) in the GUI config. If you run on Windows the configuration is located in AppData\Roaming\qobuz-dl, otherwise in home/.config/qobuz-dl

Upon running the program you have to log in with your Qobuz credentials. You can manually log out from config, or by deleting the config file.
